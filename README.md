# Energy Databrowser 2018

This repository contains work done to build an updated version of the original
[Energy Export Databrowser](http://mazamascience.com/OilExport/).

This project is sponsored by Mazama Science and co-sponsored by the Open Data Literacy project at the University of
Washington's [iSchool](https://ischool.uw.edu/).

## Databrowser Background

From the original databrowser [About Page](http://mazamascience.com/OilExport/about.html):

> Access to fossil fuels is one of the most important issues of our time. The world's largest economies are extremely
> dependent upon imported supplies of oil and gas. Understanding who produces and consumes oil, coal and natural gas
> is critical today and will remain so in the years ahead.

> This databrowser uses data from the 2017 BP Statistical Review and displays coal, oil & natural gas production
> and consumption timelines for each country in the database and several political and geographic groupings of nations.
> Users can dynamically plot import/export curves to get a sense of who the major fossil fuel producers and consumers
> are and how this has changed in the last four decades.

# Notes from 3/6/2018

Need more guidance on exactly what plots to create.

Some suggestions to break up the tasks:

 * create an html page with good HTML/CSS/bootstsrap desing (with help from Jon)
 * keep working on map as needed (but it looks pretty good)
 * disregard trade data and focus on annual by country statistics (production/consumption by fuel source)
 * use Papa Parse 4 (or d3) to ingest csv files
 * all plots should support a wide range of years and countries (but not necessarily all)
 * create scatter plot
 * create area plot
 * create stacked bar (stacked area?) pkot
 * stay in sync and share functions as much as possible (refactor/cleanup code)
 * test deployment on github IO
